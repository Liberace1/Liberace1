## 🔧 My Expertise

### **Cloud DevOps Engineering**

- **AWS**: 
  - Managing cloud infrastructure with **EC2**, **S3**, **RDS**, **VPC**, **EKS**, **IAM**, **Lambda**, and more. I design and implement highly available and fault-tolerant architectures in the cloud.
  - Creating **infrastructure-as-code** with **CloudFormation** and **Terraform** to automate provisioning and scaling of resources.

- **Docker**:  
  - **Containerization**: I specialize in **Docker** to package applications and deploy them in isolated environments for consistency across different platforms.
  - I automate container deployments on **AWS ECS**, **EKS**, or **self-managed Kubernetes** clusters to ensure smooth scaling and management.

- **Ansible**:  
  - Automating cloud infrastructure and configurations using **Ansible** playbooks and roles. I use it for seamless application deployment and ensuring the system is in the desired state.

### **CI/CD Pipeline Automation**

- Implementing **CI/CD** pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment phases, ensuring fast and reliable delivery of applications to production environments.
- Leveraging **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI**, and **CircleCI** for continuous integration and automated testing to accelerate software delivery.

### **S3 & Storage Solutions**

- **S3 Management**: I manage **AWS S3** for secure, scalable, and cost-efficient storage solutions. From hosting static websites to backup solutions, I ensure that your data is always available and easy to manage.
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automating backup strategies using **S3** and integrating with other AWS services like **Lambda** for disaster recovery and data redundancy.
